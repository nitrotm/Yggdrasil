# CLI Module Responsibility

The CLI module covers the `@chrisdudek/yg` package — a deterministic command-line tool that implements Yggdrasil's persistent semantic memory for repositories. Reference: docs/idea/foundation.md, engine.md, tools.md.

## Architecture

The CLI is organized in a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

| Layer | Path | Role |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
| `entry/` | `bin.ts` | CLI bootstrap — registers all commands with Commander and invokes the program |
| `commands/` | `cli/` | Command handlers — thin orchestration wrappers that parse options, call core, format output, handle errors |
| `core/` | `core/` | Domain logic — graph loading, context assembly, validation, drift detection, dependency resolution |
| `io/` | `io/` | Filesystem I/O — YAML parsing, file reading, drift-state persistence, journal file management |
| `model/` | `model/` | Shared TypeScript type definitions — graph, config, node, aspect, flow, drift, validation types |
| `formatters/` | `formatters/` | Output formatting — structured output for context packages, validation results, dependency trees |
| `templates/` | `templates/` | Default config, schemas, and platform-specific agent rules (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf, etc.) |
| `utils/` | `utils/` | Shared utilities — path normalization, SHA-256 hashing, token estimation |

## In scope

- Registering and executing 15 commands: init, build-context, validate, drift, drift-sync, status, tree, owner, deps, impact, aspects, preflight, journal-add, journal-read, journal-archive
- Loading the graph from `.yggdrasil/` (config, model, aspects, flows, schemas)
- Building context packages per the 5-step algorithm (docs/idea/engine.md)
- Validating structural integrity and completeness signals
- Detecting drift between graph mappings and file hashes (SHA-256)
- Managing the session journal (buffer between conversation and graph)
- Resolving dependency order for materialization (topological sort of structural relations)

## Out of scope

- User-domain business logic (the graph is generic)
- Integration with external APIs or network services
- Writing to graph files (model, aspects, flows) — tools read and validate only; agent writes
- Capturing user intent (specify/clarify/plan) — that is process tooling, not this CLI

## Invariant

Tools never write node.yaml or artifacts. Exception: init creates bootstrap structure; drift-sync writes .drift-state; journal commands write .journal.yaml.
