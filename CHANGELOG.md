# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Flow writing instruction in rules: write flow content (e.g. `description.md`) business-first — user/business perspective, technical details as inserts only
- **Flow propagation down hierarchy:** flows now attach to listed nodes and their descendants. A child node receives flow context when its ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) is a participant, even if the child is not explicitly listed in `flow.nodes`
- Tests for flow ancestor propagation, flow-scoped knowledge, and scope-nodes knowledge

### Changed

- Drift handling: agent automatically runs `yg drift-sync` when drift is detected (preflight and wrap-up). No longer asks user "Absorb or Reject" — user does not need to know Yggdrasil internals
- Wrap-up trigger: added "ok" as a phrase that triggers session verification
- context-builder: `collectParticipatingFlows` now considers node + all ancestors; spec (docs/idea) updated accordingly

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Changed

- Updated agent prompt; ran iterations to align code with graph

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- Initial release
